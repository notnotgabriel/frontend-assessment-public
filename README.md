This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



## Tooling Conventions

- Material UI for out-of-the box components, such as buttons, tables, chips, etc.
- Styled components for any custom css
- React Query for remote data fetching


## Requirements

Please spend an hour or so on the task below. Keep in mind that our goal is to observe you code/solve problems and to get to know each other, not so much the end product.

In this task we'd like you to spend around an hour to display data from a GraphQL endpoint in a table, with some interactivity, using the tooling described above. 

- Select any one of [these apis](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/community/backend/8-free-to-use-graphql-apis-for-your-projects-and-demos/) as the data source
- Render the data in a table
- Add interactivity - for example, pagination and/or some level of filtering.
